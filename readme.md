# This is a code snapshot to the publication "Spline-Based Rotor and Stator Optimization of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor"

Arxiv version: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19065

Printed version: will follow

# Prerequisites

In order to run the code you need
- Matlab (tested with version 2024a)
- Matlab Optimization Toolbox
- Matlab Curve Fitting Toolbox
- Matlab Global Optimization Toolbox

No other packages need to be downloaded at this point. To provide a fully working snapshot, we already include here the code snapshots for the packages

- GeoPDEs (https://rafavzqz.github.io/geopdes/)
- The NURBS toolbox (https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26390-nurbs-toolbox-by-d-m-spink)
- Tensor Toolbox (https://www.tensortoolbox.org/)

which we give full credit to.


# How to run the code

In the results folder, there are several scrips that can be run. These scripts reproduce the results from the publication:
- PMSM_optimization_nonlin.m - runs the optimization (takes some time)
- PMSM_eval_init.m - evaluation of the initial geometry
- PMSM_eval_opt.m - evaluation of the optimized geometry
- PMSM_std_map.m - postprocessing of the torque std for initial and optimized geometry
- PMSM_torque_profiles.m - postprocessing of the torque profiles for the initial and optimized geometry
